## Getting started

This is the landing page for your documentation. Make updates to it by editing this file in the `/docs` folder of your repo.

You can add more pages to this documentation by adding more markdown (.md) files to the `/docs` folder. See the [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) for more information.

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents on the right is generated automatically based on the hierarchy of headings within the file. Only use one H1 (`#` in Markdown) per file.

## Site navigation

For new pages to appear in the left hand navigation you need to add them to the `mkdocs.yml` file in root of your repo. Links in the left hand navigation can link out to other sites. See the [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#nav) for more information.
